            <br>

            That said, awareness of our diet goes hand in hand with our awareness of climate change.
            According to the <a
            href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/cut-global-emissions-76-percent-every-year-next-decade-meet-15degc">United
            Nations</a>, global emissions much fall by 7.6% each year to meet the Paris Climate Agreement target if 1.5Â°C.

            <div class="bold">What is this app?</div>
            This app is meant as an educational tool that translates food on your plate into average emissions produce to get to your plate.
            <br><br>
            <div class="bold">Why Salad?</div>
            Salad has been chosen as we tend to equate salad as healthier and more 'plant-i-ful' and, therefore, better for the environment. 
            Although plants do tend to be easier on the environment, how they're produced directly informs carbon intensity. 
            Further, this app will help you understand the effect of adding animal (by)products to your salad!

            <div class="bold">How does it work?</div>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Select your salad ingredients in the dropdown list below; 
                you will see your dancing ingredient pop up in the menu below. 
                Each item selected is considered one serving per ingredient. 
                For a double serving, simply add another serving of the same ingredient.
              </li>
              <br>
            <li>
              Scroll over each ingredient to see more facts* about each one.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              As you select your ingredients, you will see the Carbon Counter* and the Percent of Fair
              Daily Food Emissions* rise. 
              </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="small">*These data have been taken from <a href="https://myemissions.green/understanding-the-fair-daily-food-emissions-value/#:~:text=Using%20the%20UN's%20target%20of,3.05%20kgCO2e%2Fday.">My Emissions</a>  
            and are calculated based on global CO2 emissions from food procution. 
            That means, your location and the specific local suppply chain are not taken into consideration.
