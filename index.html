            <div class="opening" style="font-size: 1.25em">Did you know that the food supply chain contributes to roughly 25% of greenhouse gas emissions globally?</div>

            <br>
            
            Awareness of our diet goes hand in hand with our awareness of climate change.
            According to the <a
            href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/cut-global-emissions-76-percent-every-year-next-decade-meet-15degc">United
            Nations</a>, global emissions much fall by 7.6% each year to meet the Paris Climate Agreement target if 1.5Â°C.

            <div class="bold">What is this tool?</div>
            This site is meant as an educational tool that translates food on your plate into average emissions produce to get to your plate.
            <br><br>
            <div class="bold">Why Salad?</div>
            Salad has been chosen as we tend to equate salad as healthier and more 'plant-i-ful' and, therefore, better for the environment. 
            However, how they're produced directly informs carbon intensity. 
            Further, this tool will help you understand the effect of adding animal (by)products to your salad! 
            <br><br>
            <div class="bold">How does it work?</div>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Select your salad ingredients in the dropdown list below; 
                You will see an ingredient pop up in the menu below. 
                Each item selected is considered one serving per ingredient. 
              </li>
              <br>
            <li>
              Click on an ingredient to see more facts* about each one.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              As you select your ingredients, you will see the Carbon Counter* and the Percent of Fair
              Daily Food Emissions* rise. 
              </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="small" style="font-size: 10px;">*These data have been taken from <a href="https://myemissions.green/understanding-the-fair-daily-food-emissions-value/#:~:text=Using%20the%20UN's%20target%20of,3.05%20kgCO2e%2Fday.">My Emissions</a>  
            and are calculated based on global CO2 emissions from food procution. 
            That means, your location and the specific local suppply chain are not taken into consideration.

      <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p> This data point is measured in 'CO2e' (Carbon Dioxide equivalent). 
            That means that all greenhouse gases produced by making your meal were converted into CO2 as a measuring stick.
            Therefore, this measurement offers insight into the amount of CO2 equivalent emissions produced from your production to your plate.</p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            <p>Data are based on the global average CO2 production of food products. They, therefore, do not take into consideration
            local production of your meal. This, therefore, could lead to inaccuracies.</p>

      <div id= "pop-out-title">The Percent Daily Food Emissions</div>
      <br>
      <ul>
          <li>
            This data point shows the percentage of your salad's CO2e emissions 
            measured against the quota of daily food emissions that should come from out meals. 
            
          </li>
          <li>
            The quota is 3.05kg CO2e per day.
            This daily amount is based on the UN recommended amount in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees celsuis.
