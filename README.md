<h3>Background</h3>

In light of climate change , "What's in your salad?" is meant to raise awareness about the carbon footprint on your plate, in particular in your salad. In fact, our eating habits contribute to climate change more than we know. 

Although a fresh salad with vegetables, fruit, nuts and a salad dressing may seem light on the stomach, this data visualizer aims to uncover how 'light' it is on the environment.

<h3>How it works</h3>

1. Look on your plate or the ingredients you have in your fridge that you want to put in your salad.
2. Navigate to the dropdown menu on the page and scroll to choose each ingredient in your salad. The ingredients will show up around the salad bowl and the average CO2 footprint of your plate. 
3. Mouse over each ingredient dancing around the salad bowl to see the average CO2-footprint and more information on the ingredient's footprint. If you want to delete an ingredient, you can click the 'x' next to the dancing ingredient.
4. Mouse over the total average CO2 footprint for a short description on that.
5. You can click in the 'about' section for a brief description on this app.


<h3>Functionality & MVPs</h3>
Users will be able to:

- Access Nav links which are: project's Github, LinkedIn, and Github profil.
- Click on a dropdown menu to select ingredients in their salad. 
- Delete ingredients from the 'menu'.
- Mouse over ingredients dancing around the salad bowl, and information on the ingredients.
- The 'About' will have click functionality - upon clicking, brief information on the page and about climate change will appear. As such, the user will be able to read information about the background of the data visualizer. 

<h3>Technologies, Libraries, APIs</h3>
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- API for the images used for the salad.
- D3 - maybe

<h3>Implementation Timeline</h3>

Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Setup project file structure properly, access all relevant (API) images and data needed for the ingredients. Get functionality for a simple dropdown menu and about menu showing up on the webpage that the user can interact with. 

Monday: Dedicate this day toward making the salad bowl and vegetables show up on the page (no CSS or other functionality yet). Ensure that when the user selects a vegetable from the dropdown menu, it renders the image on the page. Add mouse-over functionality per vegetable where the CO2 footprint/ information will appear and add functionality to delete the image. 

Tuesday: Today is a day for CSS! Make sure to format the vegetables and salad bowl correctly on the page and make them dance. Add a nice background and work on adding a button that--when clicked--pops open another blurb about climate change and food production. 

Wednesday: Finish styling and nav links. If time, start on bonuses.

Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.

<h3>Bonus features</h3>
1. Add information/ data on water use. 
2. Add option for user to choose region. Based on that, shows a list and distribution of fresh produce grown in that region.
3. Refactor CO2 footprint of vegetables based on region. I.e. peaches grown and sold in Georgia have less of a carbon footprint than transported, processed, and sold in New England.
4. Interactive visual of a US map on distribution of veggies, fruits and nuts/legumes grown in the USA. There is also potential to add data on imports/ exports per region on this map.
