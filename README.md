<h3>Background</h3>

In light of climate change , "How Green is your salad?" is meant to raise awareness about the carbon footprint on your plate, in particular in your salad. In fact, our eating habits contribute to climate change and understanding the carbon footprint of food production is important.

Although a fresh salad with vegetables, chicken, and nuts may seem light on the stomach, this data visualizer aims to uncover how 'light' it is on the environment.

<h3>How it works</h3>

1. Read instructions in the About section. Look on your plate or the ingredients you have in your fridge that you want to put in your salad.
2. Navigate to the dropdown menu on the page and scroll to choose each ingredient in your salad. The ingredients will show up under the dropdown menu and the counter of average CO2e will tick up. 
3. Mouse over each ingredient to see more information on each ingredient's footprint. 
4. View the two counters: 1) the average CO2-footprint and 2) the percent fair daily emissions. Click the popup below the counters to see how they're measured. 
5. If you want to delete an ingredient, you can click on the ingredient to delete it.

NOTE: the data sources and referenced are in the about section of the webpage.

<h3>Functionality & MVPs</h3>
Users will be able to:

- Access Nav links which are: LinkedIn, Github profile, and more information on climate and food production.
- Click on a dropdown menu to select ingredients in their salad. 
- Delete ingredients from the 'menu'.
- Mouse over dancing ingredients to read more information on the ingredients.
- The 'About' will have click functionality - upon clicking, brief information on the page and about climate change will appear. As such, the user will be able to read information about the background of the data visualizer. 
- read more information about the counters.

<h3>Technologies, Libraries, APIs</h3>
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Gifs for dancing images
- Data from website: My Emissions

<h3>Implementation Timeline</h3>

Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Setup project file structure properly, access all relevant (API) images and data needed for the ingredients. Get functionality for a simple dropdown menu and about menu showing up on the webpage that the user can interact with. 

Monday: Dedicate this day toward making the salad bowl and vegetables show up on the page (no CSS or other functionality yet). Ensure that when the user selects a vegetable from the dropdown menu, it renders the image on the page. Add mouse-over functionality per vegetable where the CO2 footprint/ information will appear and add functionality to delete the image. 

Tuesday: Today is a day for CSS! Make sure to format the vegetables and salad bowl correctly on the page and make them dance. Add a nice background and work on adding a button that--when clicked--pops open another blurb about climate change and food production. 

Wednesday: Finish styling and nav links. If time, start on bonuses.

Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.

<h3>Bonus features</h3>
1. Add information/ data on water use. 
2. Add option for user to choose region. Based on that, shows a list and distribution of fresh produce grown in that region.
3. Refactor CO2 footprint of vegetables based on region. I.e. peaches grown and sold in Georgia have less of a carbon footprint than transported, processed, and sold in New England.
4. Interactive visual of a US map on distribution of veggies, fruits and nuts/legumes grown in the USA. There is also potential to add data on imports/ exports per region on this map.
